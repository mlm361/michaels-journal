# Blogging My Way: Typora + Git + Cloudflare + Micro.blog

This post serves two purposes. First, it marks the inaugural entry 🥳 on my new blogging system.
 I'm using Typora ✍️ to write and save my posts locally in a folder. From there, I `git push` them to my GitHub repo 🔁, which then deploys to Cloudflare Pages 🌐. Finally, the RSS feed is imported into Micro.blog 📰.

It’s not as elegant as MarsEdit 💻—the polished Mac-only tool—but it works for now and lets me keep using Typora, which I really like.
I tried Obsidian 🧩, but it felt too complicated. The whole "vaults" system 🤯 didn’t click with me. Typora is just simple and clean ✅.
