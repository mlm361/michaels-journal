I’ve always wanted a telescope. Something I could use to take photos and videos of the night sky with my phone or camera. I recently came across a YouTube video about the Zwo Seestar S50, but since this is my first telescope, I decided to start with the more beginner-friendly **S30** and bought it for my birthday.

I’ve owned it for a couple of months, but only recently started using it seriously. Here are some of the first photos I captured with it on **July 4, 2025**:

These images were taken right from my front yard — I still can’t believe the clarity. Here’s one I took with my phone (Galaxy S24 Ultra, no zoom) while I was setting up the Seestar:

Later that evening, we heard fireworks going off in the distance. While the moon was the star of the night, I also caught this fun fireworks shot from our front yard. We were hearing more fireworks from our neighbors all around us than we were actually seeing.

I’m planning to set up a dedicated page in the future as I learn more about using the **Seestar S30**. I hope you enjoyed these photos as much as I enjoyed experimenting with the telescope. It’s truly amazing how it filters out light and zooms in on the moon with such detail.
